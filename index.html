This page is dedicated to my favorite handlheld calculator, the TI-30Xa. I made it to serve several purposes:
<ul>
<li> To practice my test-driven development. A suite of tests have already run by the time your browser loads this page. These allow me to refactor my code with confidence and debug quickly.
<li> To see if I really understand how my calculator works. I have already learned a few things, such as the limited order-of-operations the 30Xa has. Also, this may seem obvious, but I also realized for the first time that the display segments are at a five degree angle. Here is another intersting fact: if there are no open parentheses, the close-parenthesis button does the same thing as the equals key.
<li> So I can demonstrate using this calculator in class without the glare which comes from using the document camera, and students can follow along on their smartphones if they left their calculator at home. In particular, this could fill a similar role to TI-SmartView, which as of right now is not available for the 30Xa.
</ul>

I plan to implement the 7-segment display using <a href="http://www.3quarks.com/en/SegmentDisplay/">this library from 3quarks.com</a> (Thanks RÃ¼diger Appel for putting it under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons 3.0 licence</a>!), but I have not done that yet. For now a text based display will have to do.
</p>
<p>
I also intend to include a feature for showing the button press history, probably with several modes (showing just the keys, showing the keys and display, showing additional information usually concealed to the user).
</p>
<p>
I may have to leasrn some CSS for this, but I would also like this page to look nice.

This web page was made by Alden Bradford circa January 29, 2021. May it help us all to know our calculators better.
