# issues
This project is far from done! additional tasks include:

## making it pretty

 - Show an alert of some sort when a not-implemented key is pressed.
 - Display the history pretty, using images of the keys.
 - Make the keys react visually when pressed.
 - Use CSS to align everything nice and use good colors.

## making it functional - implement these:

 - alternate display modes
 - constant key
 - statistical register
 - memory
 - polar/cartesian conversion, and angle formats
 - fractions
