# calculator_emulator
A Javascript simulacrum of a TI-30Xa.

# issues
This project is far from done! additional tasks include:

## making it pretty

 - Display the history pretty, using images of the keys.
 - Make the keys react visually when pressed.
 - Use CSS to align everything nice and use good colors.
 - Get the favicon to display correctly.
 - Hide the debug info

## making it functional - implement these:

 - alternate display modes
 - constant key
 - statistical register
 - memory
 - polar/cartesian conversion, and angle formats
 - fractions

## new features

 - use the same base-10 floating point representation which the calculator uses, so it behaves exactly identical even in later decimal places.
 - add a mode to show my proposal for the perfect pocket calculator. It should be almost identical, but it should do away with the polar subsystem and use the three freed-up buttons to add some conspicuously-missing functions: modulus, normal CDF, and inverse normal CDF. Also, it should allow fractions in more contexts -- I should be able to square or reciprocal a fraction without it being converted to a decimal.
